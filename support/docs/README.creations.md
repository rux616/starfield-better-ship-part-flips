Summary
-------
Adds additional flips of vanilla parts. A pure ESM mod, the flips are done using the vanilla data, no additional meshes are added. Largely stays within the grid established so far.

Better Ship Part Flips is fully compatible with [Better Ship Part Snaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5698) and they can be used together.

I plan on updating Better Ship Part Flips as often as I can, but making flips is tedious and requires care and lots of testing to ensure a good result. Be sure to check the CHANGELOG above for more info about parts changed and added.

This is a limited version of the README. The full version, including a list of all categories, can be found at the mod's GitHub repository (<https://github.com/rux616/starfield-better-ship-part-flips>).

Compatibility
-------------
General mod compatibility is limited, Better Ship Part Flips has to modify some of the data that also contains properties such as hull, mass, etc.

Known Issues
------------
None.
