Version: 1.1.0


Summary
-----
NOTE: Now requires the Ship Builder Categories (https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/f4c658c4-77f0-4362-af7e-4aa07072598e/Ship_Builder_Categories) mod!

Adds additional flips of vanilla parts, thus far including shields, cargo holds, fuel tanks, grav drives, reactors, and structural parts. A pure ESM mod, the flips are done using the vanilla data, no additional meshes are added. Largely stays within the grid established so far. Also includes "decorative" versions of shields, cargo holds, fuel tanks, grav drives, reactors, and weapons.

Better Ship Part Flips is fully compatible with Better Ship Part Snaps (https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/81dc21ae-e497-441b-aaf9-b44b923d1401/Better_Ship_Part_Snaps) and they can be used together.

This is a limited version of the readme. The full version can be found at the mod's page on Nexus Mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5953), or in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/rux616/starfield-better-ship-part-flips).


Load Order
-----
For best results, put this mod lower in your load order, followed by any patches.


Compatibility
-----
General mod compatibility is limited as Better Ship Part Flips has to modify some of the data that also contains properties such as hull, mass, etc. There are some patches available, either included in the installation archive if you're downloading from Nexus Mods, or as separate mods if you're using Bethesda.net Creations.


Known Issues
-----
- Sometimes one or more ship modules will appear randomly rotated on your ship. This is purely cosmetic and a save/reload almost always fixes it.
