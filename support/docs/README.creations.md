Version: 1.3.1


Summary
-----
NOTE: Now requires the Ship Builder Categories (https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/f4c658c4-77f0-4362-af7e-4aa07072598e/Ship_Builder_Categories) mod!

Adds additional flips of vanilla parts, thus far including shields, cargo holds, fuel tanks, grav drives, reactors, and structural parts. A pure ESM mod, the flips are done using the vanilla data, no additional meshes are added. Largely stays within the grid established so far. Also includes "decorative" versions of shields, cargo holds, fuel tanks, grav drives, reactors, and weapons.

There are a few options patches available to prevent the decorative items from showing, increase cargo hold capacity by 3x, and increase cargo hold capacity by 10x; search for "BSPF Option" to find them. Additionally, a number of compatibility patches are available for various mods, which can be found by searching for "BSPF Patch".

Better Ship Part Flips is fully compatible with Better Ship Part Snaps (https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/81dc21ae-e497-441b-aaf9-b44b923d1401/Better_Ship_Part_Snaps) and they can be used together.

This is a limited version of the readme. The full version can be found at the mod's page on Nexus Mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5953), or in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/rux616/starfield-better-ship-part-flips).

Compatibility
-----
General mod compatibility is limited as Better Ship Part Flips has to modify some of the data that also contains properties such as hull, mass, etc. There are some patches available, either included in the installation archive if you're downloading from Nexus Mods, or as separate mods if you're using Bethesda.net Creations.

- "All ship parts unlevelled at all vendors (ESM)" by SKK50 [Nexus (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6060)]: [Patch Required] Depending on whether BSPF or this mod is set to higher priority, either some parts simply won't show up or will still have level or vendor requirements. Use the included compatibility patch. (checked 2024-08-12; version 002)

- "Better Ship Part Snaps" by freschu/rux616 [Creations (https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/81dc21ae-e497-441b-aaf9-b44b923d1401/Better_Ship_Part_Snaps) / Nexus (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5698)]: If using the Ship Colorize compatibility patch, there is an additional patch (included) that should be used to restore feature parity with Better Ship Part Snaps. Note the flips added by Better Ship Part Snaps don't all have any particularly enhanced snaps. (checked 2024-08-12; version 1.0.0)
- "DarkStar Astrodynamics" by WykkydGaming [Creations (https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/cfca357a-7226-4cae-bd16-3575069dcf2e/DarkStar_Astrodynamics) / Nexus (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/9458)]: Fully compatible. (checked 2024-08-12; version 4.1.1)

I got tired of trying to make it work, and so just ripped out support for them. (checked 2024-08-12; version 1.1)

Known Issues
-----
- Sometimes one or more ship modules will appear randomly rotated on your ship. This is purely cosmetic and a save/reload almost always fixes it.
